// PackingSlip.js
// Schema for new packing slip which is part of the split shipping modules (2.19^)
// A packing slip consists of:
// - orderNumber    (to aggregate easily)
// - packingSlipId  (unique human-readable identifier)
// - items          (refs to work order items & qty in packing slip)
// - shipment       (ref to shipment-if any-that contains this packing slip--can only be one)
